====================================================
DDA Query to pull Course Backup Cleanup List
Built on top of Heather Crites query
(https://github.com/hcrites-cscc)

Outputs the same fields as the python script 
however, it does set the deleteMe column to Y
by default. This can be changed by the user.

Feel free to also change the creation_date setting
in the where clause. It is set at 365 by default
just as in the python script.

The where clause also includes a commented
out and clause which allows you to specify
a specific date.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
